# Project7
Via GitHub I am trying to show my learning journey step by step. These repositories not only contain major projects but also the most minor projects also so that my learning journey graph can be analyzed properly. In my seventh project I designed a clone of Spotify website using only HTML and Vanilla CSS. This webpage of mine is not responsive.
